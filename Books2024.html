                            This is an exceptional resource for those who want to start learning about the numerical
                            methods
                            used to solve IVPs. Authors adopt a step-by-step approach, explaining new ideas and
                            providing numerous examples and simulations to illustrate the concepts. Mathematical
                            complexities
                            are kept to a minimum making it easy to grasp the fundamental concepts. I particularly
                            enjoyed
                            reading the chapters on geometric integration of Hamiltonian systems for long-term
                            simulations;
                            specialized methods designed to preserve system invariants.
                            Overall, this book is a great starting point to learn about the subject.
                            I truely enjoyed it!

                            This book is quite unique. On one hand, it covers a wide range of interesting ideas; on the
                            other, there are a lot of places in the book where the authors introduce concepts without
                            providing immediate explanations, challenging the reader to persevere and think critically.

                            This book demands active engagement and a willingness to refer to external resources to
                            grasp
                            the more complex ideas.

                            Compared to the previous title (1), it provides a more in-depth analysis of the subject
                            matter
                            using more sophisticated mathematics.

                            End-of-chapter exercises aim to engage the reader by introducing new concepts that were not
                            discussed in the main content of the chapter.
