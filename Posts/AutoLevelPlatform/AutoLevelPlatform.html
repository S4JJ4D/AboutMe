                            In this work, we consider a four-legged leveling platform and develop a control strategy to
                            automatically
                            orient the platform to correct roll and pitch angle errors assuming the vehicle was
                            initially situated on a sloping terrain. For this purpose, an FE model is constructed
                            followed by a two-level control system with its hyperparameters tuned in repeated
                            simulations.
                        </p>
                        <p>Redundancy in critical systems is often desirable as it improves overall robustness. As such,
                            four-legged systems are capable of carrying higher loads and also resist overturn.</p>

                        <p>According to the structural model, all linear actuators are oriented perpendicular to the
                            main frame. Actuators are modelled as prismatic joints while the connection between rods and
                            foots are abstracted as spherical joints.</p>

                        <p>This system has -2 degrees-of-freedom: platform is structurally
                            locked (negative value for degrees of freedom signifies an <i>overstructured</i> mechanism)
                            and, as
                            stated earlier, system motion is realized through deformation of flexible parts (chassis) in
                            the
                            system. In the following figure, as we impose kinematic displacement on the actuators,
                            flexible members of the system begin to deform.

                        <p>Finite-element model is constructed in ABAQUS while the controller is implemented in
                            SIMULINK.
                            To connect these software components, we use FMU-based Co-Simulation to perform a coupled
                            simulation.
                        </p>
                        <p>Simulation is carried out in three major steps as outlined below and shown in the following
                            figure.</p>

                        <p>Control strategy is implemented in a hierarchical structure where two control loops are
                            embedded in a multi-level control system and work in concert to achieve control objectives.
                            The main control loop (low-level) is the primary computational unit that implements
                            the main logic of leveling operation. High-level control loop acts a supervisory controller
                            by monitoring the overall condition of operation and environmental variables and enforcing
                            transition between various control modes.

                            Abaqus uses the SIMULIA Co-Simulation Engine Director (CSE) as a software component for
                            controlling a co-simulation. Specifically, it is in charge of coordinating and synchronizing
                            execution and communication between all clients involved in the co-simulation.
                            According to Abaqus documentation, CSE can be used to execute a structural-to-logical
                            co-simulation between a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU) subsystem (as a logical component) and
                            a
                            Abaqus subsystem (as a structural component).
                            FMI supports (a) sharing (exchange) of dynamic models (FMU-ME), and (b) co-simulation of
                            dynamic models via the transfer of solution results from one dynamic model as input to one
                            or more other dynamic models (FMU-CS).
                            With FMI-ME, the FMU does not contain a solver. Instead, the solver is provided by the tool
                            which imports and assembles the overall system model. A single solver can be used for
                            multiple FMUs. The joint simulation is therefore not a co-simulation. The co-simulation
                            solution approach is used when multiple dynamic models associated with different engineering
                            disciplines are used to simulate a time-dependent coupled system or subsystem. In this case,
                            the models associated with each particular discipline are solved each by their respective
                            solvers in a distributed way during runtime.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Simulink models can be exported as a special form of FMU objects known as Tool-Coupling FMU.
                            When Simulink-exported FMU and Abaqus job are connected to CSE, Simulink editor and Simulink
                            project are loaded, and co-simulation starts automatically. This session can be used to
                            pause, resume co-simulation, as well as tune parameters or plot signals from the command
                            window while co-simulation is running. Various parameters must be configured for proper
                            execution of co-simulation. Notably, coupling scheme and rendezvousing scheme should be
                            carefully selected since they have significant impact on simulation quality and results.
                            "Minimum-Timestep" and "Gauss-Seidel" methods are used for rendezvous and coupling scheme,
                            respectively. Following figure shows the overall structure for a co-simulation.

                        There is more to talk about, but I'll wrap it up here.
